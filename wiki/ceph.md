# Ceph

Ceph is the spaceship

In general the ship is designed to be durable, reliable, low/easy maintenance, upgradable, and efficient.





## Generations

## Systems and Features

### Hull

The initial launch and 2nd launch were sporting an ablative shield due to the lack of a viable energy-based alternative. On Voyage2 (????) a very basic system was fitted that made entry operations easier.

photovoltaics, perfect efficiency plus being able to reverse to act as cloaking (at least for photons). In supported systems there are laser power delivery systems available that can deliver focused energy to each craft but this requires an upgraded system.

#### Time

A standard tuned-quartz oscillator was used for the gen 1 craft which resulted in various mishaps until it was upgraded to a cesium-based [Atomic clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock)

Clock systems always require re-calibration after FTL travel, even via Warp Ferries. This usually happens automatically via services provided on each Ferry (assuming that it is working properly). It is extremely difficult for a passenger vessel to track time from within a warp field because it does not have an accurate reference frame without being connected directly to the navigational and control systems of the ferry. Advanced pirates are sometimes able to read out this information through security vulnerabilities in Ferries, although it is a constant battle to ensure that these vulnerabilities remain secret and un-fixed. Generally pirates will choose to use the standard re-calibration and recovery protocols unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid detection.

#### Navigation

*AstroLoc* (Gen 1)

This is a system that uses two dome-shaped receivers mounted on the front of the craft. Each of them is a 180 degree "camera" capable of capturing photons in relevant energy bands. The relative positions of notable "landmark" objects can be used to discern the location and orientation of the craft. 

This system is 
- exceptional at determining orientation (heading)
- good at determining location 
- okay at determining velocity

Weaknesses
- Relies on accurate calibration of the sensors as well as an accurate clock. Deviations in clock accuracy will add to the 

*[IMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit)* (Gen 1)

Uses a [Ring laser gyroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_laser_gyroscope) to measure rotation as well as a

Gas scoop & processing
Navigation (AstroLoc)
Photon absorption & emission coating (solar power + cloaking)

Stellar travel

Multiple-mode EMSail
- Configure field strength/shape for different environments
- Could switch between solar wind and interstellar plasma modes
- Adaptable to different regions of space

Solar sail

## Planetary surface

Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrust works by:

Basic Principle:
- Gas (usually argon/hydrogen) is ionized into plasma
- Strong electric current passes between electrodes
- Magnetic fields accelerate the plasma
- Creates thrust through electromagnetic forces

Components:
1. Central Cathode
2. Circular Anode
3. Strong Magnetic Field Generator
4. Power Supply (very high current needed)
5. Propellant Feed System

Current Limitations:
- Requires massive electrical power (megawatts)
- Electrode erosion at high power
- Heat management challenges
- Currently only practical in space

Potential Future Improvements:
- Room temperature superconductors would help
- Better electrode materials
- More efficient ionization methods
- Advanced cooling systems
- More compact power sources

For sci-fi purposes, you could imagine a breakthrough that allows:
- Atmospheric operation
- More compact design
- Lower power requirements
- Use of atmospheric air as propellant
- Integration with other propulsion methods

MPD is interesting because it's real technology that could be plausibly extended with near-future developments.

it would also fit in well with an EM sail!

Yes, exactly! They would complement each other really well because:

1. Shared Technology:
- Both use electromagnetic fields
- Similar power systems could be used
- Common expertise/engineering
- Could share superconducting components

2. Complementary Operations:
- MPD for strong thrust when needed
- EMSail for efficient long-distance travel
- MPD could work in atmosphere
- EMSail works best in space

3. Hybrid Operations:
- Could potentially use same magnetic field generators
- Switch between modes as needed
- MPD could boost craft to where EMSail is effective
- EMSail could provide course corrections while MPD recharges

4. Story Elements:
- Makes sense technologically
- Gives different capabilities for different situations
- Creates interesting plot possibilities
- Feels "hard sci-fi" while still being advanced

Ionic Gas Mode (Atmosphere):
- Lower power, less efficient
- Works in dense atmosphere
- Good for low altitude/landing
- Uses ambient air
- Quieter operation

MPD Mode (Near Space/Vacuum):
- High power, high thrust
- Best in vacuum/near vacuum
- Orbital operations
- Uses carried propellant
- Powerful acceleration

EMSail Modes:
Solar System:
- Uses solar wind
- Stronger near sun
- Combined with solar sail effects
- Efficient cruise mode

Deep Space:
- Uses interstellar medium
- Different field configuration
- Lower thrust but constant
- Very efficient for long hauls

The system could automatically switch modes based on:
- Atmospheric density
- Available particle density
- Power levels
- Mission phase
- Required thrust

Yes, those limitations create great narrative tension and logical constraints! Here's how it could work:

Ship's Operating Modes & Limitations:

Local Operations:
- Limited MPD fuel for planetary ops
- Must carefully plan surface missions
- Every landing burns precious fuel
- Creates strategic decisions

System Travel:
- EMSail for efficient but slower travel
- MPD for emergency maneuvers only
- Forces planning ahead
- Makes distance matter

Interstellar Solution:
Warp Ferry System:
- Regular scheduled routes
- Emergency beacon for rescues
- FTL comms for coordination
- Creates infrastructure backdrop

This creates interesting story elements:
- Resource management
- Risk/reward decisions
- Can't just "zoom anywhere"
- Realistic constraints
- Makes distance meaningful
- Creates potential plot complications

Plus the ferry system adds:
- Meeting points
- Schedule dependencies
- Potential for missed connections
- Social/economic implications
- Established trade routes

These limitations make the universe feel more real and create natural plot tension!
