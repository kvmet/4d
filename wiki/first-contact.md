# First Contact

Nikole is a Tanuki.

Nikole receives an unknown package. She is used to receiving packages that she isn't expecting. She constantly is selling and buying new electronics stuff for her projects. She likes radio, comms, understanding comms, software development, music, synthesizers, robotics, making stuff, etc. She is not surprised that there is an unexpected package, but she is definitely surprised when she doesn't recognize it after she opens it. 

somehow it looks like something that she made (don't SAY this). it has some notable signs on the PCB. stuff that she puts in her own circuits. It looks meticulously laid out, but more like someone trying to be careful rather than someone incredibly skilled. This is clearly not the first iteration of the device since there are some very new boards as well as some other components that seem just kind of soldered on and taped to the back.

it is clearly supposed to fit into a rack similar to her other synthesizers. It also has similar connectors. She is a little wary of it and takes some measurements and plugs it into a separate power supply. She is a bit afraid to plug it into anything important at first. She takes a bunch of measurements. It looks fine. She sleeps on it.

She tries to hook it up though and not much happens. It just seems to make some weird grumblings for about 30 minutes and then seems to totally shut down. Nothing happens.

She later gets some other messages "out-of-band" (mail or just dropped off or something). She needs to feed in a carrier signal with some very specific modulation parameters that are synchronized to reliable clock signal. It's not really clear why this needs to happen but she eventually scrounges up enough to do it. (maybe she just gets the clue that it needs to be the right modulation and figures out the clock part on her own?)

She finally is able to hear what is coming through. It sounds like a pre-recorded message at first but then there is a short break and it launches into a lecture. It seems very "jargony" and strange so she just sets up a recording device and starts recording it to decipher later.

After some time she realizes that it is transmitting theses lectures on a regular interval and cycle with a shorter message between. The shorter message is a call and an announcement. Listen, learn, build, meet. listen to the lectures, pay attention and learn, build the machine, meet at the location and time 

(a location IS a time after all, right? .... maybe you can actually somehow take a ferry back to an earlier "ferry" in time but it costs an insane amount of money due to regulations that are designed to prevent tampering? so the only way is to either pay the fees and get approval or steal the trip and never return? maybe the return trip is always impossible? maybe it isn't actually "possible" but sometimes you can wrangle your way into it in a very risky way? who knows. oh maybe having to return to a previous ferry location is also how we can explain not being able to travel forward? maybe it is still not possible in the future to transmit enough data backwards to enable forward travel. maybe it is discovered in the future but requires some kind of comms method that means that it can't go back beyond a certain point which winds up actually protecting the past... ALSO maybe in the future someone is trying to hack NIKA, or succeeded, and that's why she dropped everything to come back because that is jeopardizing everything? or maybe it isn't that dangerous universally but is just violating to NIKA once she realized it was happening?)

She realizes after a while that this is real. The pieces start clicking together. She builds the thing. She waits for the day. She doesn't tell anyone. She tries to take off. The ship does actually start to pick up and gains altitude but she realizes that she has a leak and her life support systems can't keep up. There's no way that she can make it. FUCK.

another "year" passes. she fixes her leaks and adds redundancy. she integrates the receiver into her ship. she has basically memorized the lectures by now. She wishes there was more to them. it makes sense kind of enough to build what she is building but she can't figure out WHY. why does it have to be this way? clearly there is still a lot hidden.

she tries to leave again. it works she is able to leave the earth's sphere of influence. she notices around the time that she is taking off that the comm device has a horrible modem-like sound run through it and it resets and the counter value (I guess there is a counter on it?) resets. right as she starts to truly be out of the sphere of influence of earth her navigation system clocks the ferry leaving. it is like missing your bus except now you have to wait months for it to come back. she is encouraged by her success but starts to wonder how she could have been so close (saw it leave) but so far (would have taken her months to get there). now it sucks because she is far away and has to use all of her reserves trying to get back.

turns out that there is a combination of factors. Nika forgot to account for stupid earth time zones and accrued leap years and stuff. This aspect actually got fixed . Nikole was using an inaccurate clock (simple quartz time module). actually there are 2 years between ferries. the first time she tried to leave it wouldn't have even been there. Also her clocks were off because Nika was bumming a ride and it didn't re sync properly... `I dunno this kind of seems inconsistent. get device. try to understand it for a while (time passes). understand (time passes). build a thing (time passes). try it. fail. fix. recover. try again........`
