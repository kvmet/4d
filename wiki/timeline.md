# Timeline

Nikole first developed comms, then she started talking to interstellar folks, they gave her some tips but couldn't reveal too much due to "first contact" rules. 

progression:
- comms (does future nika come back and give nikole comms?)
- contact
- build ship
- get to ferry
- take ferry
- learn about stuff
- make some more trips, see some more places, want to explore more
- can't explore "cool" stuff without augmentation
  - need to be able to survive deep space. cryo is okay but mods are preferred to handle nutrition, statis, etc. etc.
