# Timeline

Nikole first developed comms, then she started talking to interstellar folks, they gave her some tips but couldn't reveal too much due to "first contact" rules. 

## Chapters

- First Contact
  - Nikole receives a mysterious music synthesizer module. Not knowing the source, Nikole plugs it into an isolated system and doesn't notice any problems. She checks a few connections and then assumes it must be from one of her friends who is also into synths and decides to try it out. When she plugs it in, she realizes it is a specialized receiver that is picking up some sort of pre-recorded message. The device does not let her transmit but it just sounds like gibberish. The day after hooking it up she receives a set of instructions for how to configure it that let her decipher what it means. It is a set of instructions for how to acquire materials and how to design a craft for travel within a solar system. The message also gives a time (years in the future) and a location (far out in the solar system) as well as some guidance for how to avoid detection. Nikole gets to work.
  - We discover later that Nikole actually created this device in her own future and the transmitted message has been available for centuries to anyone with a subspace receiver. 
  - Maybe if it is going to be a repeating message she will miss the first or second ferry and then finally makes it for a third? OH or maybe her first voyage she actually does get off planet but misses the bus because of some time sync issue and that's when she upgrades her clock?????
- Voyage 1
  - After years of work, Nikole takes off. She doesn't tell anyone (or does she?) about what she is doing. she makes it to the rendezvous point and boards the Ferry.
  - Voyage 1 what does she gain? what does she NEED? (maybe cloaking to make future trips easier? although this might not be very good without shields). Perhaps the magnetic drive systems can just naturally act like shields from the get-go and so the ablative shielding and cloaking don't even matter?? maybe she adds ablative shielding of her own accord out of fear and is just told to remove it because it is making her ship inefficient?
- Voyage 2
  - Maybe gets shields?

progression:
- comms (does future nika come back and give nikole comms?)
- contact
- build ship
- get to ferry
- take ferry
- learn about stuff
- make some more trips, see some more places, want to explore more
- can't explore "cool" stuff without augmentation
  - need to be able to survive deep space. cryo is okay but mods are preferred to handle nutrition, statis, etc. etc.
